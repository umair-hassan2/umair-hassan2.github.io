## ViT-Insight: Vision Transformer Attention Explorer (2025)

Interactive visualization of per-layer attention in ViT models, tracing how input patches collectively contribute to model predictions across layers and heads.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-label support** for comprehensive analysis
- **Layer-range selection** for targeted exploration
- **Customizable heatmap overlays** for detailed visualization
- **Dynamic GIF generation** showing layer-wise attention evolution
- **Attention Rollout computation** for understanding decision pathways

### Impact:
Enhanced transparency and trust in transformer-based vision models, providing a tool for explainable AI research and evaluation of vision-language alignment.
