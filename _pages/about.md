## Biography

I'm Umair Hassan, a motivated researcher driven by curiosity for mathematics, coding, and understanding how intelligent systems perceive the world. My fascination with learning and reasoning has guided me to the crossroads of artificial intelligence and computer vision, where I aim to build models that not only see but truly understand. Fun fact: as a child, I dreamed of creating autonomous cars but fortunately (or unfortunately for me), that problem got solved before I did. The curiosity that started there now fuels my drive to explore what comes next.

My work now centers on exploring the foundations of intelligent visual understanding. How models interpret, adapt, and generalize from the world around them. I'm continuously seeking new problems that challenge conventional boundaries and expand our grasp of what AI can truly achieve.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie primarily in computer vision, with a focus on model interpretability, quantization, and adaptation. I'm intrigued by how vision systems can learn compact yet expressive representations, adapt efficiently to new domains, and offer transparency in their decision making processes. Beyond these areas, I'm broadly curious about emerging directions in multimodal learning and efficient AI, and remain open to exploring diverse topics that advance our understanding of how intelligent systems perceive and reason about the world.
