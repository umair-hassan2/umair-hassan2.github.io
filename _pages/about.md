## Biography

I'm Umair Hassan, a researcher interested in how machines perceive, reason, and learn from multimodal information.

My work lies at the intersection of computer vision, representation learning, and interpretability, where I explore how models can move beyond correlation to develop structured, explainable understanding of the world.

I'm fascinated by the challenge of aligning model perception with human cognition—how visual and linguistic representations can be unified in transparent, data-efficient ways.

My broader goal is to contribute to intelligent systems that not only perform well, but also reveal how and why they understand.
